        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <h6>FashHanger is a bespoke sustainable high-fashion accessory company based out of Berlin, currently operated
          by
          Siesly and her sister Ashely. They needed help for a big rebrand and wanted to relaunch their website.
          <p> Their goals were simple, create a unique e-commerce store that bring a wonderful shopping experience at
            every stage of the buyer’s journey.</p>

        <h6>Who is your user? Indicate her KEY personality traits and help round out her overall image.
          <p>
            Originally, the personality section of this persona was based off the Myers Briggs personality test.
            According to the Myers Briggs, there are 16 potential user personality types. Our template integrates
            questions from this online personality test example into a series of sliding bar graphics. If you’re
            confused as to what the sliders mean, check out the Myers Briggs basics article.</p>

      <div class="second">
        <h6>In the beginning, It’s just about brainstorming.<p>
            I list out a jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related to what I’m working on (and find the parallels
            later). Personally, I prefer paper with a grid so I can convey things responsively. Most of the time
            perfection isn’t an issue and the sketches are just for me.</p>

      <h3>Final Design</h3>
      <div><img src="image/lamp.png"></div>
      <div class="finish">
        <h6>I played with adding a wireframe of the website flow that would lead you in to each screen. For each of
          those screens I added a floating footer that allows users to see where they are in that particular flow and
          jump around as needed.” We’re digging this InVision-made wireframe.</h6>
